## üöÄ Project Overview

**AgriCredAI** is an innovative agricultural lending platform that harnesses **Agentic AI**, **Machine Learning**, and **Real-time Data Intelligence** to revolutionize credit risk assessment for financial institutions and enhance financial inclusion for farmers.

### üéØ Problem Statement
Agricultural lending traditionally faces challenges such as:
- High default rates (8-15% industry average)
- Manual and slow risk assessment
- Limited data integration from critical sources like weather, market, and soil
- Poor access for small-scale farmers
- Reactive instead of proactive risk management

### üí° Our Solution
AgriCredAI delivers an AI-driven platform that features:
- Autonomous Agentic AI for smart decision-making
- Advanced ML models with 85-92% prediction accuracy
- Real-time monitoring of 50+ influential variables
- Dynamic, crop cycle-aligned loan structuring
- Carbon credit tokenization for sustainable finance
- Multi-lingual voice-enabled accessibility
- Weather forecasting alerts for proactive risk mitigation

## üìà Hyper-Realistic Agricultural Credit Risk Model

You can explore the ML training and modeling for our credit risk assessment in this [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12xL5iaHnDJRT7C_rj4rDcs5yKoJI8jcn?usp=sharing).

The model assesses farmer creditworthiness across India with 85-92% accuracy by analyzing 50+ features grouped into these weighted risk categories:

- **Primary Risk Factors (40%)**: Payment history, debt burden, income stability  
- **Climate & Weather Risks (25%)**: Region-specific drought probability, crop vulnerabilities, temperature stress  
- **Market & Economic Risks (20%)**: Price volatility, market access, input costs  
- **Infrastructure & Support (10%)**: Irrigation access, insurance coverage, cooperative membership  
- **Agricultural Practices (5%)**: Soil health, technology adoption, crop diversification  

The risk model integrates regional intelligence for 8 major Indian states, incorporates interaction effects and protective factors, and uses ensemble methods for optimal accuracy. It enables business use cases such as risk-based pricing, financial inclusion, and portfolio management with real-time scoring powered by Streamlit.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works: System Architecture & Workflow

### Data Ingestion & Perception  
- Data sources: Agmarknet (commodity prices), OpenWeatherMap (weather), satellite imagery, soil sensors, credit bureau data, farmer surveys  
- Collection Agents aggregate diverse sensor and API data asynchronously into a local SQLite cache  

### Agentic AI Orchestration  
The **AgenticOrchestrator** manages three autonomous AI agents concurrently, each with perception ‚Üí reasoning ‚Üí action ‚Üí feedback learning loops:

1. **Dynamic Financing Agent**: Tailors loan amounts and adaptive repayments based on real-time risk and crop cycles  
2. **Carbon Credit Agent**: Calculates CO‚ÇÇ sequestration by farmers and issues tokenized carbon credits on a blockchain-like ledger  
3. **Market Advisory Agent**: Provides intelligent pricing forecasts and sale recommendations for crop marketing

### Machine Learning Risk Model  
- Uses 50+ hyper-realistic, correlated features covering demographics, climate stress, market volatility, and physical infrastructure  
- Ensemble of Random Forest, XGBoost & LightGBM models achieving 92.4% AUC  
- Uses SHAP for transparent feature importance explanations

### Dashboard & User Interface  
A comprehensive Streamlit UI with nine sections delivers rich, interactive insights:  
- Executive Summary  
- Portfolio Analytics  
- Credit Risk Scoring  
- Agentic AI Demo  
- Weather Risk Monitor  
- Market Intelligence  
- Geographic Risk Mapping  
- Performance Analytics  
- System Configuration

### Feedback & Continuous Learning  
The autonomous agents continuously collect outcome data to refine loan decisions and improve the machine learning models over time.
