## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd agricred/advanced\ agri
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run Setup Script
```bash
python setup.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Check all dependencies
- 🗄️ Initialize the database with sample data
- 🤖 Train the machine learning models
- 📝 Create configuration files

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project directory:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your API keys:
```env
# API Keys
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key_here
MARKET_API_KEY=your_agmarknet_api_key_here
SOIL_HEALTH_API_KEY=your_soil_health_api_key_here

# Alert System Configuration
SMS_ENABLED=False
EMAIL_ENABLED=False
```

## 🚀 Running the Application
