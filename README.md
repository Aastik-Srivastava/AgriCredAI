## üöÄ Project Overview

**AgriCredAI** is an innovative agricultural lending platform that harnesses **Agentic AI**, **Machine Learning**, and **Real-time Data Intelligence** to revolutionize credit risk assessment for financial institutions and enhance financial inclusion for farmers.

### üéØ Problem Statement
Agricultural lending traditionally faces challenges such as:
- High default rates (8-15% industry average)
- Manual and slow risk assessment
- Limited data integration from critical sources like weather, market, and soil
- Poor access for small-scale farmers
- Reactive instead of proactive risk management

### üí° Our Solution
AgriCredAI delivers an AI-driven platform that features:
- Autonomous Agentic AI for smart decision-making
- Advanced ML models with 85-92% prediction accuracy
- Real-time monitoring of 50+ influential variables
- Dynamic, crop cycle-aligned loan structuring
- Carbon credit tokenization for sustainable finance
- Multi-lingual voice-enabled accessibility
- Weather forecasting alerts for proactive risk mitigation

## üìà Hyper-Realistic Agricultural Credit Risk Model

You can explore the ML training and modeling for our credit risk assessment in this [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12xL5iaHnDJRT7C_rj4rDcs5yKoJI8jcn?usp=sharing).

The model assesses farmer creditworthiness across India with 85-92% accuracy by analyzing 50+ features grouped into these weighted risk categories:

## Key Innovation: Multi-Factor Risk Scoring

### 1. **Primary Risk Factors (40% weight)**

- **Payment History**: Track record of loan repayments
- **Debt Burden**: Debt-to-income ratio with exponential penalties above 50%
- **Income Stability**: Yield consistency based on farming practices

### 2. **Climate & Weather Risks (25% weight)**

- **Drought Risk**: Region-specific drought probability (Maharashtra 60% vs Punjab 20%)
- **Crop-Specific Vulnerabilities**: Rice/Cotton/Sugarcane more frost-sensitive
- **Temperature Stress**: Non-linear impact of extreme weather

### 3. **Market & Economic Risks (20% weight)**

- **Price Volatility**: Cotton (35%) vs Wheat (12%) volatility
- **Market Access**: Distance to mandis affects selling costs
- **Input Cost Pressure**: Fertilizer and seed cost fluctuations

### 4. **Infrastructure & Support (10% weight)**

- **Irrigation Access**: Reduces drought risk by 30%
- **Insurance Coverage**: Safety net against crop failures
- **Cooperative Membership**: Community support systems

### 5. **Agricultural Practices (5% weight)**

- **Soil Health**: Nutrient deficiency and degradation risks
- **Technology Adoption**: Modern farming techniques
- **Diversification**: Multiple crops reduce single-crop risk

## Regional Intelligence

- **8 Major States**: Punjab (wheat/rice), Maharashtra (cotton), UP (diverse), etc.
- **State-Specific Patterns**: Irrigation rates, cooperative culture, income levels
- **Crop-Region Matching**: Realistic crop selection based on geography

## Advanced Features

- **Interaction Effects**: High debt + weather stress = exponential risk
- **Protective Factors**: Education, cooperatives, insurance reduce risk
- **Ensemble Methods**: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM for optimal accuracy [ Best Model: XGBoost (CV AUC: 0.9060) ]
- **SHAP Explanations**: Transparent decision-making for loan officers
- **20% Default Rate**: Realistic for agricultural sector

It enables business use cases such as risk-based pricing, financial inclusion, and portfolio management with real-time scoring powered by Streamlit.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works: System Architecture & Workflow

### Data Ingestion & Perception  
- Data sources: Agmarknet (commodity prices), OpenWeatherMap (weather), satellite imagery, soil sensors, credit bureau data, farmer surveys  
- Collection Agents aggregate diverse sensor and API data asynchronously into a local SQLite cache  

### Agentic AI Orchestration  
The **AgenticOrchestrator** manages three autonomous AI agents concurrently, each with perception ‚Üí reasoning ‚Üí action ‚Üí feedback learning loops:

1. **Dynamic Financing Agent**: Tailors loan amounts and adaptive repayments based on real-time risk and crop cycles  
2. **Carbon Credit Agent**: Calculates CO‚ÇÇ sequestration by farmers and issues tokenized carbon credits on a blockchain-like ledger  
3. **Market Advisory Agent**: Provides intelligent pricing forecasts and sale recommendations for crop marketing

### Dashboard & User Interface  
A comprehensive Streamlit UI with nine sections delivers rich, interactive insights:  
- Executive Summary  
- Portfolio Analytics  
- Credit Risk Scoring  
- Agentic AI Demo  
- Weather Risk Monitor  
- Market Intelligence  
- Geographic Risk Mapping  
- Performance Analytics  
- System Configuration

### Feedback & Continuous Learning  
The autonomous agents continuously collect outcome data to refine loan decisions and improve the machine learning models over time.
